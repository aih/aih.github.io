### Modernizing Law and Legislation

My latest passion is to create software to modernize the legislative process. This work is featured by the [Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress](https://modernizecongress.house.gov/) at the House of Representatives. I've gotten to work together with great people in the Office of the Clerk, Law Revision Counsel, Government Publishing Office and other government agencies.
colleagues at Xcential Corporation.
