Last week started with <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/20/legal-startups/">an article</a> by Christina Farr in VentureBeat on a new generation of legal technology start-ups, including Tabulaw. For all the recent coverage given to law and law school in the New York Times and other mainstream media publications, there has been comparatively little on legal technologies. In part, that may be due to the fact that a clear inflection point--where the pace of innovation visibly accelerates--has been slow to materialize in law. Indeed, the author did not sugar coat the difficult reality of start-ups in this space.  But I believe that the article reached an important audience of engineers, tech entrepreneurs and investors, who can help this inflection take place.  And I have been fortunate, as a result of the article, to be able to speak with some of the trailblazers in legal tech, including Rich Granat, who started the mylawyer.com network, and Donna Seyle, founder of Law Practice Strategy.  Both will be presenting at the <a href="http://www2.americanbar.org/calendar/TECHSHOW/Pages/default.aspx">ABA Techshow</a> in Chicago.  And though I will miss that event, thanks to these recent contacts and the growing legal tech community in the Bay Area, I feel that I've gotten a mini version of the Techshow experience out West.
