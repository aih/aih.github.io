If you were wondering what the internet is for, you've come to the right place. &nbsp;Apparently, this blog is one of the top ten results for the search "<span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: #f7f7f7; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; white-space: nowrap;">what are uses for the internet".</span><br /><br />How do I know?  The <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> report for this blog showed that phrase as one that led here.<br /><br />So if you're wondering, my 2 cents on the subject:  one great use for the internet is to make legal information more accessible. While I think that the internet can be valuable to share <a href="http://flickr.com/">photos</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/tabulaw1">videos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/arihersh">tweets</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">tumbles</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/legal%20technology">sparks</a> and other gems, it can also be used to share our basic legal rulebooks and court decisions in a way that is accessible to everyone who is bound by them.
