Annette Nellen at 21st Century Tax has <a href="http://21stcenturytaxation.blogspot.com/2014/06/summer-hearings-on-comprehensive-tax.html" target="_blank">written a post</a> on Congressional hearings this summer on tax reform. The Senate Finance Committee, led by Senators Wyden (D-OR) and Hatch (R-UT), will consider topics including:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Education incentives</li><li>Identity theft and privacy</li><li>"Modernizing" corporate taxation</li><li>Tax simplification</li></ul><div>As I mentioned in a comment on Annette's blog, I would like to see Silicon Valley weigh in, particularly on tax simplification, with ideas to simplify the code and technology to simplify tax filing. I have <a href="http://blog.tabulaw.com/2012/01/tax-simplification-within-grasp.html" target="_blank">discussed this before</a>, including the great potential to use (big) data from hundreds of millions of actual filings to simplify tax law and the practice of filing.</div>
