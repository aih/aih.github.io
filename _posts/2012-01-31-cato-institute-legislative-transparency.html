<div>An email to the Sunlight Foundation's OpenGov listserve from Jim Harper of the Cato Institute points to <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/helping-the-house-advance-data-transparency/" target="_blank">his blog post</a>, chock full of links and information, about the upcoming House <a href="http://cha.house.gov/about/contact-us/legislative-data-conference" target="_blank">conference on legislative transparency</a>. &nbsp;Among the references are a number of quite detailed and on-target recommendations that Cato is making for the drafting process and content.</div><div><br /></div><div>In particular, Cato proposes a <a href="http://wac.0873.edgecastcdn.net/800873/blog/wp-content/uploads/2b-Conceptual-Data-Model-of-US-Formal-Legislative-Processes.html" target="_blank">legislative data model</a>&nbsp;that would include a great deal of useful metadata at every level of a bill. &nbsp;The model is quite similar to the California legislative model described at <a href="http://legix.info/">legix.info</a>, parts of which I worked with in the California Law Hackathon. Although the model requires adding a lot of different kinds of metadata to the text, &nbsp;all of that data is easily available when a bill is being written (e.g. the bill sponsor). It is much more difficult to extract by parsing after the fact. As <a href="http://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/05/california-law-recovering-meaning-and.html" target="_blank">I've discussed </a>in earlier posts, a richly marked-up legislative text would be very valuable, and goes hand-in-hand with the&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.tabulaw.com/2012/01/legislative-standards-us-house.html" target="_blank">recommendations I make</a>&nbsp;to make the text itself more amenable to automated analysis.</div><div><br /></div>
