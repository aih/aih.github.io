<div style="clear: both;">As the Wiener scandal reminds us, Congress doesn't quite have the hang of this internet thing. So I take the liberty here to provide 5 suggestions of better things Congressmen could be doing with their access to the web and our tax dollars:</div><div style="clear: both;"><table style="border: 1; cellpadding: 15; cellspacing: 20; width: 500px;"><tbody><tr> <td></td><td style="font-weight: bold; width: 220px;">DO</td> <td style="font-weight: bold; width: 200px;">DON'T</td> </tr><tr><td>1.</td>  <td><a href="https://wapo.st/2EWlmH">Write in Plain English</a></td> <td><a href="https://huff.to/m5tPCi">Mistweet constituents</a></td></tr><tr><td>2.</td> <td><a href="https://www.blogger.com/fn1">Make Laws Web-Friendly</a></td> <td><a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/savethedata/">Cut Funding for Transparency</a></td> </tr><tr><td>3.</td>  <td><a href="https://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=7029518648320057552&amp;postID=1931406767070268464#fn1">Make Court Opinions Accessible</a></td> <td><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/us/politics/10lee.html">Seek Love on Craigslist</a></td> </tr><tr><td>4.</td>  <td><a href="https://www.stemedcoalition.org/">Invest in Science and Tech Education</a></td> <td><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/02/congress-and-court-long-simmering-debate-over">Add Facebook and Google to DHS</a></td> </tr><tr><td>5.</td>  <td><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/06/anthony-weiner-press-conference-pictures-photos_n_872108.html">Keep Your Shirt On</a></td> <td>See Link in Previous Column</td> </tr></tbody></table></div><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><div style="clear: both;"><span id="fn1"><u>How to Make Laws Web-Friendly</u></span><br /><br />As I showed with California's statutes, now at calaw.tabulaw.com, legislators can take a few simple steps to make laws more accessible online. &nbsp;Congress can start by publishing laws in a structured data format, identifying sections and subsections, as well as all references in the text. &nbsp;This has been an <a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/04/congress-commits-to-e-data-formats.html">underlying theme</a> for this blog.<br /><br /><span id="fn2"><u>How to Make Court Opinions Accessible</u></span><br /><br />Fund the Federal Courts to publish opinions in a single, open, online database. &nbsp;At a minimum, each opinion should have a permanent link and id #, paving the way for vendor-neutral citations. What would this mean? The government would not have to <a href="https://boingboing.net/2008/04/04/us-judiciary-opts-to.html">pay millions of dollars</a> to buy back its opinions from legal publishers. &nbsp;This should reduce costs upfront as well, since today each court has its own IT department that is responsible for maintaining its own website and publishing its opinions, resulting in a hodgepodge of formats. A few projects, like <a href="https://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/resource.org/recop.shtml">RECOP</a> from public.resource.org and <a href="https://www.blogger.com/courtlistener.com">CourtListner</a>, are collecting and redistribute these opinions. &nbsp;But these projects cannot correct for the loss of data that occurs before the opinions are published online in the first place.</div>
