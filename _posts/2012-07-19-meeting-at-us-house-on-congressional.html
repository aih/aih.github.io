Tomorrow (July 20), there is going to be an "<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=b334af1d70a1adf54f14341a114e7d35&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0" target="_blank">industry day</a>" to discuss the U.S. House modernization project. &nbsp;This includes projects from both the Office of Legislative Counsel (responsible for bill drafting) and the<span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;Law Revision Counsel (responsible for codifying legislation into the U.S. Code). &nbsp;The project specifications describe goals for data encoding of U.S. legislation that point toward a truly modern system-- in which references in legislation can be identified and easily hyperlinked, and in which it might be possible to get an up-to-date version of a law without having to manually trace the entire amendment history.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><br />As I've mentioned before, technology alone is not enough. &nbsp;Congress needs to take at least two steps in the way it writes bills, in order to make legislation more amenable to automated updates and analysis:<br /><br />1. Move ahead with positive law codification: the Law Revision Counsel has prepared a number of Titles of U.S. law for passage into positive law. &nbsp;This would mean replacing the cobwebs of hundreds of overlapping laws and amendments with a single, authoritative text. &nbsp;This is never an urgent matter for Congress, but it does represent a very important and long overdue Housecleaning. For each Title that is passed into positive law, Congress now has a single base from which to work when making amendments.<br /><br />2. Write new bills with full section-by-section text replacements. &nbsp;Currently, bills may change a single word, a sentence or an entire passage. &nbsp;The amendment is often described in words ("change the last word of the fourth sentence..."). &nbsp;Replacing entire sections makes automated redlining much more practical and effective, meaning that we could all more easily see what effect any new bill has on the existing legislation.<br /><br />Of course, there is much more that could be said about each of these points, and about the goals that the Legislative Counsel and Law Revision Counsel have set out. &nbsp;I am very encouraged to see the political will gathering to make technological changes to the way bills are drafted, and I just hope that Congress can also make the bureaucratic changes necessary to support this new technology.
