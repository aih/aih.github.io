I've wrapped the California Laws website in an Android application for even faster access from your mobile phone.<br /><br />[UPDATE: I have shut down the live CA Laws demo website; legix.info provides the internal hyperlinks that I had built into my site, and is kept up-to-date. The Android app is also not working now.] Download the new California Laws app <a href="https://www.appsgeyser.com/getwidget/California%20Law">here</a> for free, test it out and let me know what you think. &nbsp;To install, you need to download directly to your Android device and open from the System tray.<br /><br /><b>Background:</b><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">In theory, going from a&nbsp;<a href="https://calaw.tabulaw.com/">mobile-friendly website</a>&nbsp;to a web application for Android, iPhone or iPad should be relatively simple. &nbsp;And in practice, it now is, within limits. &nbsp;I used a new web-based service to create this "version 1" California codes Android application. The website that I used to make this app, appgeyser.com, is a bit slower than I'd like for normal page rendering, but otherwise they offer an impressive service. I have no relation to Appgeyser, but this looks like the fastest way to go from website to application, and is a good way to test how your site would look as an application.</div><div><br /></div><br />A few downsides which can be cured in future versions:<br />- Tables of contents require scrolling across the screen<br />- Appgeyser puts an ad at the bottom of the application for their service<br /><br /><br /><br />
