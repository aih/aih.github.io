Last week's <a href="http://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/07/nyt-law-school-reform-and-innovation-in.html">NYT OpEd</a>s on law school reform continue to reverberate in the legal community - especially among law students and recent graduates.<br /><br />One answer for graduates, as <a href="http://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/07/nyt-law-school-reform-and-innovation-in.html">I suggested</a>, is to proactively define and promote <b>their own expertise</b>. &nbsp;Another is for this generation of new graduates to join with other new graduates and <b>use technology to their advantage</b>. &nbsp;This generation may face the <b>worst economic situation</b> for lawyers since the 1930's, and are largely being shut out of traditional firms. &nbsp;But they are also (by definition) the <b>most wired generation</b> ever and have access to technologies that can bring tremendous value and efficiency to legal practice. &nbsp;These technologies include:<br /><br />1. Social networking to bring in business from around the corner and around the globe.<br />2. Better, inexpensive and free online research platforms.<br />3. Virtual law firms, which can lower overhead and increase transparency by providing links to the public work product of firm lawyers, and facilitate rating or referrals from clients.<br />4. Workflow technologies to offer better and more efficient service to clients.<br /><br />We're working on a couple of these technologies (see tabulaw.com, tax26.com) and I believe that the next couple of years will bring many more. <br /><br />If you are part of this new generation of lawyers, what role do you see for technology in law? &nbsp;What technologies would you like to see for lawyers?
