<p style="clear: both">I've made some improvements to <a href="https://calaw.tabulaw.com" title="California legislation" target="_blank">calaw.tabulaw.com</a>, which has all of California's legal codes with internal links for easy navigation of the laws. It now also has a fast search engine, powered by Sphinx.</p><p style="clear: both">Know anyone who works with California state law? Pass this on to them. Anyone in the legislature? They might want to replace the aging <a href="https://leginfo.ca.gov" title="California's official legislation site" target="_blank">leginfo.ca.gov</a>...</p><br class='final-break' style='clear: both' />
