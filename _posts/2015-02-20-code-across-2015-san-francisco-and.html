I'm looking forward to join more than a hundred other programmers and civic activists at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-San-Francisco-Civic-Hack-Night/events/219705688/">Code Across 2015 event in SF</a>, part of <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/">Code Across 2015</a>, an event collaboratively organized by Code for America as part of <a href="https://opendataday.org/">International Open Data Day</a>.<br /><br />The scope of Open Data Day can be seen from this very long <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ruewy74XVCCyp89YzqsyeoKTjLmyzNHo0hrjr3djiyQ/edit#gid=661950110">list of other Open Data Day hackathons and events</a> (Google Document, not sure where it came from).<br /><br />And if this event is your kind of thing and you want to make it your day job, get in touch with me. At Xcential, we're always looking for civic-minded programmers who are interested in working on browser-based applications for writing, amending and publishing law. We work with the state of California, Hong Kong, the U.S. Congress and others to bring law into the digital age.<br /><br />Happy Hacking!
