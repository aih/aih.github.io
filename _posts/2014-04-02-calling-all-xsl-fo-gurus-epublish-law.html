My last recruiting post <a href="http://blog.tabulaw.com/2014/02/waking-up-again.html" target="_blank">did so well</a>&nbsp;(welcome again, Ian Davey) I'm doing it again. We are looking for someone who wants to help us redefine government publishing of legal information: laws, reports, and other documents. <br /><br />Xcential works with the U.S. House of Representatives, the State of California, Hong Kong, among others. In these projects, we have the opportunity to help define document data formats (XML for the U.S. Code, for example) and a new workflow for publishing legal documents electronically.<br /><br />Have you worked with XSL-FO or other e-publishing technologies? Do you know someone who has? Are you self-directed? Interested and able to work from anywhere (we have 6 team members in 5 cities)?<br /><br />Get in touch.<br /><br />Now. What are you waiting for?
