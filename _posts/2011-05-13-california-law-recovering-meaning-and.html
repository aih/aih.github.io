<div style="clear: both;"></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Georgia, Utopia, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"></span><br /><div style="clear: both;">In a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/05/losing-data-in-pdf-all-kings-sources.html" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;">previous post</a>, I mentioned some of the challenges in <b>recovering</b>&nbsp;meaningful structural information (titles, paragraphs) from pdfs, and&nbsp;<strong>why</strong>&nbsp;government entities should retain this information when they publish electronic documents.</div><div style="clear: both;">I'll have more to say in future posts about&nbsp;<strong>what</strong>&nbsp;information is important to retain, which, at a minimum, should include document structure (titles, sections, paragraphs and other meaningful divisions) as well as references to other documents (statutes, Constitutional provisions, court decisions, etc.). This does not even touch on the <b>meaning</b>&nbsp;of the documents, but at least makes it possible to more easily navigate electronic documents.</div><div style="clear: both;">As a motivation for my next (technical) post on&nbsp;<strong>how</strong>&nbsp;to recover some of this information from existing plain text legislation using a variety of open source Linux utilities, Perl packages and Python functions, I'll take a look at a section from California's legislation.</div><div style="clear: both;"><a class="image-link" href="https://lh5.ggpht.com/_KSKlgXwN6_4/Tc1porhVVMI/AAAAAAAADpU/eIl2kyzGxn4/s800/CALeginfo-full.png" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;"><img align="right" class="linked-to-original" height="187" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/_KSKlgXwN6_4/Tc15BqEF-pI/AAAAAAAADp8/67SlmgeDwWo/s800/CALeginfo-thumb.png" style="-webkit-box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0976562) 1px 1px 5px; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border-bottom-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-color: initial; border-left-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1px; border-right-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1px; border-top-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1px; border-width: initial; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0976562) 1px 1px 5px; display: inline; float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; padding-top: 5px; position: relative;" width="378" /></a>California's legislation is divided into 29 codes, which can be searched from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;">this quaint official web site</a>&nbsp;from California's Legislature. The statutes themselves are posted in plain text, so a visitor to the site has to do repeated searches in order to assemble all of the references necessary to make sense of any given section of the Code.</div><div style="clear: both;">As an example, here's an apparently simple exercise for using the CA code site:</div><div style="clear: both;"><strong>What does a visitor to California need in order to legally drive a vehicle in the state without a California driver's license?</strong>&nbsp;(No Googling allowed!) One of the provisions of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=veh&amp;group=12001-13000&amp;file=12500-12527" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="CA Vehicle Code s.12502">relevant CA statute</a>&nbsp;has 3 external references, which I've identified with italics:</div><blockquote style="clear: both;"><div style="clear: both;">(b) Any person entitled to the exemption contained in&nbsp;<em>subdivision (a),</em>&nbsp;while operating, within this state, a commercial vehicle, as<br />defined in&nbsp;<em>subdivision (b) of Section 15210</em>, shall have in his or her<br />possession a current medical certificate of a type described in<br /><em>subdivision (c) of Section 12804.9</em>, which has been issued within two<br />years of the date of operation of that vehicle.</div></blockquote><div style="clear: both;">How to make sense of this?</div><div style="clear: both;">Wouldn't it be nice to have links to these references, at least, to know what definitions are being cited? My next post will discuss the many step process to identify these references and add hyperlinks through sequence of "search and replace" functions using&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia entry for Regular Expressions"><b style="background-color: #ff9999; color: black;">RegEx</b></a>. Once this link information is added, navigating and analyzing the law is still not a walk in the park, but it becomes more manageable:</div><blockquote style="clear: both;"><div style="clear: both;">(b) Any person entitled to the exemption contained in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=311517736+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Link to whole section">subdivision (a)</a>, while operating, within this state, a commercial vehicle, as<br />defined in&nbsp;<em>subdivision (b) of&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=31079626022+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Vehicle Code s. 15210">Section 15210</a>, shall have in his or her<br />possession a current medical certificate of a type described in<br /><em>subdivision (c) of&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=31084226273+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Vehicle Code s.12800 and following">Section 12804.9</a>, which has been issued within two<br />years of the date of operation of that vehicle.</div></blockquote><div style="clear: both;">As a final note: The major legal publishers (WestLaw, LexisNexis) provide this kind of link information in their commercial databases for lawyers. And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="LII Homepage">Cornell's LII</a>&nbsp;has added links to navigate between references on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="U.S. Code on LII">LII version of the Code</a>, a major step forward for public access. But even better will be when Congress (and eventually the states) includes these reference links when they first publish legislation. Another reason why&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/04/congress-commits-to-e-data-formats.html" style="color: #2288bb; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Congress commits to e-formats">this announcement</a>&nbsp;is significant.</div><div><br /></div>
