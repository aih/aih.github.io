I am excited to be going to the <a href="https://cha.house.gov/2014-legislative-data-and-transparency-conference" target="_blank">U.S. House Transparency conference</a> tomorrow (Thursday) and the Sunlight Foundation's <a href="https://transparencycamp.org/" target="_blank">Transparency Camp</a> on Friday and Saturday. Less excited for the redeye flight tonight.<br />Much of the work Xcential has been involved with, as part of the House Modernization Project, will be on view at the House conference, and I'm looking forward to meeting (and reconnecting with) the growing group of people who care about making U.S. federal law more transparent, accessible and efficient.<br /><br />If you are going to either or both of the conferences, do look for me there. I will also be following conference chatter, and maybe contributing my own, on Twitter at&nbsp;@arihersh .
