The fourth of my structural recommendations for the U.S. House conference on legislative data and transparency (being held now), is to establish a consistent XML standard from publication of a bill to incorporation in the Code.<br /><br />I'll keep this one short, since others, particularly Jim Harper of the Cato Institute, have <a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2012/01/cato-institute-legislative-transparency.html" target="_blank">described in great detail</a> what should go into this standard and why it is important.<br /><br />Here, I want to focus on the importance of having a single XML standard from the first drafting of a bill &nbsp;to its codification. &nbsp;Lest you think this is already being done, or is an easy task to accomplish, Alex Howard (@digifile) of O'Reilly media has posted&nbsp;<a href="https://pic.twitter.com/TtW2nu0w" target="_blank">a helpful flowchart</a>&nbsp;[and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/digiphile/status/165081245422858240/photo/1/large" target="_blank">here</a>] of the various offices that are involved in the first part of the legislative process (until the bill becomes law and is published by the GPO). &nbsp;The process of codification takes place after that.<br /><br />A key element of any XML standard for legislation is that it be consistent throughout this process, as it passes from the jurisdiction of one office to another.
