<div>[Edit: Sign up to join us&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=144573135629655">here</a>&nbsp;(Facebook event)]<br /><br />It's true, California's laws now come with an unofficial&nbsp;<a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=7029518648320057552#API" title="What is an API?">RESTful API</a>.&nbsp;This is a great boost for&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/08/hackathon-anyone-california-opens.html">California Law Hackathon</a>&nbsp;plans:&nbsp;now programmers can dive right in and develop innovative ways of presenting and navigating the data in their favorite format- JSON, XML, RDF among others. &nbsp;If you want to jump ahead to see the API specifications, they are available on the legix.info site&nbsp;<a href="https://legix.info/legix/spec.html">here</a> and I've posted them <a href="https://code.google.com/p/calaw/wiki/CALawAPI">here</a> on the California Law Hackathon wiki.</div><div><b>California Hackathon update</b>  <br /><div>This Sunday,&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/110878852972801908565/posts">Greg Willson</a>&nbsp;(Granicus) and I were joined by&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/116318037058484002723/posts">Alex Hendler</a>&nbsp;(Ontolawgy, LLC) in Botswana on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/res/talkvideo/hangouts/">Google+ Hangout</a>&nbsp;(my first) to help set the groundwork for the hackathon. Main points of the discussion: <br /><ul><li>Target date for the hackathon: September <strike>3-4</strike>17-18 (update)</li><li>Prepare data and tools for hackathon participants</li><li>Prepare a list of projects and goals (e.g. legislative time-machine, before and after redlining for bills)</li></ul>Notes from the meeting are <a href="https://code.google.com/p/calaw/wiki/CaliforniaLawHackathonMtg1">here</a>. Twitter hash: #calawhack  </div><div><b>How does the API fit in?</b></div><div>I spoke yesterday with <a href="https://www.xcential.com/navigate.php?p=team">Grant Vergottini</a>, founder of Xcential, who foresees a transformation in legislative technology like the one he helped to usher in to the graphic design world, with the development of Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. He has developed a web-accessible interface to the California laws, that can provide legislative data in a wide variety of formats.   This data is <b>updated daily</b>, and should lend itself well to the kind of "time machine" presentation we've discussed for the hackathon. &nbsp;In preparation for the hackathon, Grant put together the API specifications linked above. &nbsp;Test them out and share any feedback you have on this API and other tools or data you'd like to see available for California legislation.</div><div><div id="API"><b>That's great, but: What is an API?</b></div><div>A web&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>&nbsp;(Application Programming Interface) tells programmers how to access data from a website. &nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://code.google.com/more/">Google</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/rest">LinkedIn</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/06/06/apple-icloud-api/">Apple</a>&nbsp;and pretty much any "Web 2.0" site provides some API to their web services. &nbsp;In a truly&nbsp;<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Mr. Jobs</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031679/">Goes to Washington</a></i>&nbsp;moment, the Federal Register&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/">announced</a>&nbsp;last week that it was releasing a fully RESTful API, complete with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/criticaljuncture/federal_register">Github account</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/learn/developers">developer's page</a>. &nbsp;I am excited that California's laws now have their own (unofficial) API, too.&nbsp;</div></div></div>
