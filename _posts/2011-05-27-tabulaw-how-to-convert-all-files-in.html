CA legislation transformed (w. new website--check it out!) If you want to skip the more technical post below altogether, just go to <a href="https://calaw.tabulaw.com">calaw.tabulaw.com</a>.  It has no styling or search function yet, but compare the navigational flow to California's official legislative site: <a href="https://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html">https://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html</a>
