Legislative transparency is catching on. &nbsp;Exhibit 1:&nbsp;<a href="https://openingparliament.org/" style="background-color: white;">OpeningParliament.org</a>, a site<span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;to gather tools and propel legislatures toward a more open, participatory model</span><span style="background-color: white;">. The site launch was sparked&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ndi.org/PMOs-work-together" style="background-color: white;" target="_blank">conference</a><span style="background-color: white;"> hosted by the National Democratic Institute (NDI), Sunlight Foundation and the Latin American Network for Legislative Transparency (LANLT)</span><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;last month in Washington.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">The site links to the </span><a href="https://www.openingparliament.org/declaration" style="background-color: white;" target="_blank">Declaration on Parliamentary Openness</a><span style="background-color: white;">, which, among other provisions, calls for release of data in&nbsp;open, structured and non-proprietary formats and for allowing bulk download of data.</span><br /><div><br /></div><div>As the political movement for open data grows, the <a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2012/05/international-legislative-unhackathon.html" target="_blank">legislative unhackathon</a>&nbsp;we held last month showed one of the tools that can be used to support it. &nbsp;The <a href="https://legalhacks.org/Editor/" target="_blank">legislative XML editor</a>&nbsp;(AKN-editor) that we used for the event was initially built as an <b>educational tool</b> - to give users first-hand experience with the Akoma Ntoso XML standard for legislation. &nbsp;You can see the editor in action in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOb-D1riJD4&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">10 minute tutorial video</a> that was prepared for the unhackathon.<br /><br />The editor will now be used to teach Akoma Ntosa in the <a href="https://summerschoollex.cirsfid.unibo.it/" target="_blank">Lex2012 summer course in Ravenna, Italy</a>. In addition, Professor Monica Palmieri, a leading expert in legislative data standards, and a participant in the unhackathon, has also showed off the AKN-editor to parliamentary staff in Brazil.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Latin American Network for Legislative Transparency, a co-sponsor of the OpeningParliament.org &nbsp;site, has also been very active in educating legislatures about the value of adopting XML standards for legislation, and we are hopeful that the AKN-Editor can help make the transition to data standards more user friendly. &nbsp;In fact, Chile has recently called for proposals for an XML based editor for their legislative drafting (full disclosure-- I was part of a bid submitted for this RFP), and I can envision more parliaments in Latin America moving down this path, which could ultimately result in a platform for legislation that makes access easier and improves collaboration between nations.</div><div><div><div><br /></div></div></div>
