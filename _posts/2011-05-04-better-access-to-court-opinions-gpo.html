Today, the Government Printing Office (GPO), through its digital printing arm, <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/">FDSys</a>&nbsp;announced a pilot project in twelve Federal Courts to publish electronic court opinions. &nbsp;Read the announcement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/pdfs/news-media/press/11news23.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;(pdf) [update: <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/News/NewsView/11-05-04/New_Pilot_Project_Will_Enhance_Public_Access_to_Federal_Court_Opinions.aspx">here</a>'s the announcement from the U.S. Courts website, with links].<br /><br />Court opinions are already available from the courts' websites, and -- for those with an access account -- from PACER, the Federal courts' electronic filing system. &nbsp;The difference now, presumably, is that GPO will introduce some uniformity to the electronic format for published court opinions.<br /><br />That is a good thing. &nbsp;Even better, will be for these opinions to include metadata about the document structure. &nbsp;<a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/05/losing-data-in-pdf-all-kings-sources.html">As I discussed yesterday</a>, most court opinions today are published online in pdf format scrambling much of the information about document structure, and losing much of the value from publishing in an electronic form.
