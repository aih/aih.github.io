Do you love law, but hate bluebooking? Do you think we should be able to apply <a href="http://www.quora.com/Public-Policy/What-are-the-nontechnical-barriers-to-adopting-a-version-control-system-for-use-in-writing-bills-and-new-laws" target="_blank">version control to law</a>, but know better than to just <a href="http://www.quora.com/Could-Git-be-used-to-track-bills-in-Congress" target="_blank">dump the U.S. Code into git</a>?<br /><br />Then you might be the person for us. We are looking for a few strong programmers with an interest in and (hopefully) understanding of law. Web stack (html/css/js)&nbsp;+ XML&nbsp;+ document parsing experience are all big plusses. As is ambition, integrity and an itch to change the world.<br /><br /><h4>Who are we?</h4><div><a href="http://xcential.com/" target="_blank">Xcential</a> has built legislative drafting and repository systems for more than a decade. In the last couple of years, we have taken on a number of exciting projects, working on legislation and codification projects from Hong Kong and Chile to the U.S. House. What you see online about our work is just the tip of the iceberg.</div><div><br /></div><div>Interested? Send a resume or a link to me at ari.hershowitz at xcential dot com. Or tweet me your interest (@arihersh) and a link to something interesting about you.</div><br /><br /><br />
