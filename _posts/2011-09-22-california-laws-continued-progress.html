Our work continues to translate the results of the first&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/09/california-laws-hackathon-details.html">California Laws Hackathon</a>&nbsp;for public consumption:<br /><br />A small core of hackers, consisting of Grant Vergottini, Greg Willson, Mike Tahani and myself (with support from Karen Suhaka's excellent team at <a href="https://billtrack50.com/">BillTrack50</a>) is moving forward to apply the sample&nbsp;<a href="https://calawhackdemos.fanjajamii.org/simile/local_example.html">timeline</a>&nbsp;to all &nbsp;sections of California's codes, and to link external data to code sections. &nbsp;In particular, Matt has written functions to link Maplight.org's <a href="https://maplight.org/apis/bill-positions">lobbyist and bill positions data</a> to California statutes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we're working with <a href="https://www.commoncause.org/">Common Cause</a> (Philip Ung), <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a> (Laurenellen McCann) and <a href="https://maplight.org/">Maplight</a> (Jeff ErnstFriedman and team) to debrief hackathon results and apply this momentum to strengthen Open Government initiatives in California.<br /><br />If you want to chip in, contact me, or add to the growing wiki <a href="https://code.google.com/p/calaw/wiki">here</a>.
