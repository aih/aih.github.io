This Sunday, August 7 at 1pm PST, we are having a virtual + in-person planning meeting for the hackathon, with a twitter hashtag #CaLawHack.<br /><br />I've set up a collaborative editor at https://rasa.tabulaw.com/p/calaw so we can jot notes for the planning meeting itself.<br /><br />Look for more details on <a href="https://govfresh.com/">govfresh.com</a>, where Luke Fretwell has generously offered to publicize the meeting.<br /><br />
