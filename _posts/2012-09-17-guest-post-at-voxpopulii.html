Grant Vergottini and I were given the opportunity to write about our exploits with legal hackathons and legislative editors over at the <a href="https://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2012/09/17/standardizing-the-worlds-legislative-information-one-hackathon-at-a-time/" target="_blank">VoxPopuLII blog</a>. &nbsp;Do go over there and disagree with us in the comments. &nbsp;We welcome a heated discussion.
