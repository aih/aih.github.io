Last week, Amazon Web Services notified me that something went wrong with the hardware hosting our California Codes site (<a href="https://calaw.tabulaw.com">calaw.tabulaw.com</a>). Bad timing, given our <a href="https://code.google.com/p/calaw/wiki/CaliforniaLawHackathon">preparation</a> for a <a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/08/hackathon-anyone-california-opens.html">California Law Hackathon</a>.  I built this originally as a side project and didn't have a back-up (note to future self), so I had to rebuild it from the sources. After a few trials and errors, the site is now live again, and I've added more notes to the <a href="https://github.com/aih/calaw#readme">CAlaw github Readme</a> about how to host this Django site on Amazon EC2.  In theory, that should allow anyone to build and host their own site for California Legislation, but it's not so easy, so <i>carpe hacker</i>.
