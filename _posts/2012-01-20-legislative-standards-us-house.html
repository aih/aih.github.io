The U.S. House will hold a conference about transparency and legislative data on February 2, 2012 (with remote streaming?). &nbsp;As Daniel Schuman of the Sunlight Foundation <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/01/19/house-of-reps-sets-conference-on-public-access-to-legislative-info-on-feb-2/" target="_blank">writes</a>, "This is a big deal." &nbsp;In this time of extreme partisanship and one-upmanship in politics, legislative data transparency is both important and that both sides can, in principle, agree on.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I've <a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/06/free-advice-to-congress-5-better-uses.html" target="_blank">written before</a> about the <a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/04/congress-commits-to-e-data-formats.html" target="_blank">importance</a> of consistent standards in legislation, the use of meaningful metadata, and the value of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-nontechnical-barriers-to-adopting-a-version-control-system-for-use-in-writing-bills-new-laws" target="_blank">version control</a>. Federal legislative data currently passes through at least five offices on the way to being codified. &nbsp;Because of many historical quirks, the codified version (the "U.S. Code") is often <b>not the actual law</b>, though for convenience most people, even lawyers, pretend that it is. &nbsp;Simplifying the content of the law, as President Obama and others have <a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2012/01/tax-simplification-within-grasp.html" target="_blank">called for in tax law</a>, becomes harder when the basic technical issues of changing the law are so arcane and complex.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Feb. 2 conference, brings together six offices that prepare legislative data on its way from bill to code, and can spark the creation of a unified data standard to make creating and understanding the law more accessible. &nbsp;In the next few posts, I will detail some suggestions of key changes that would advance these goals. &nbsp;For example:</div><div><br /></div><div><ol><li>Write in plain English</li><li>Write changes to statutory sections as full replacements of previous sections. Use a consistent format to make changes (e.g. <i>"Section 444 is amended to read as follows:"</i>).&nbsp;</li><li>Commit to enacting <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/codification/legislation.shtml" target="_blank">positive law codification</a> for all Titles. A positive law codification project for <i>Title 26</i> should be considered as a non-partisan starting point for the effort to simplify tax law.</li><li>Adopt a clean and simple XML data standard for Federal Legislation.</li></ol><div>These are not original suggestions, nor are they comprehensive, but making these changes would provide the foundations for a far more transparent legislative framework.</div></div>
