<div>So, while Congress debates whether to raise the debt limit or cause <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/2011/07/10/2308033/catastrophic-damage-if-debt-ceiling.html">catastrophic damage</a> to the country's economy, we diligently worked on making further improvements in the way we display tax law on <a href="https://tax26.com/">tax26.com</a>. &nbsp;And one of the items that is causing our parsing engine to choke, is Section 139D of the Tax Code. &nbsp;Search for it on any site you like:&nbsp;<i>(26 U.S.C. 139D)</i>. &nbsp;(Thanks to Sergey, author of the parsing engine, for pointing this out!)</div><div><br /></div><div>It's not easy to find, and if you find the section at all, you may become a bit puzzled. &nbsp;There are, in fact, two section 139D's:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R7tfz4R2tc4/Th0wB_3wPYI/AAAAAAAADxA/Oi72iyFC9d8/s1600/139Ddupe.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="102" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R7tfz4R2tc4/Th0wB_3wPYI/AAAAAAAADxA/Oi72iyFC9d8/s320/139Ddupe.png" width="320" /></a></div><div>One deals with school vouchers, and the other with "Indian health care benefits". &nbsp;How did this happen?</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, the D is what happens when Congress runs out of numbers. &nbsp;Here, there was a 139 and a 140, and Congress stuck in a few additional sections between them. &nbsp;And apparently added a second 139D, without knowing that that numbering already existed. &nbsp;As the Law Revision Council's note states: "3! So in original. Two sections 139D have been enacted."</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eeIH3TuiZm8/Th0w6bZw08I/AAAAAAAADxE/8C9Cdq0DTrg/s1600/TwoSections+139D.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="36" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eeIH3TuiZm8/Th0w6bZw08I/AAAAAAAADxE/8C9Cdq0DTrg/s320/TwoSections+139D.png" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>I pointed out before the <a href="https://blog.tabulaw.com/2011/06/cleaning-up-california-law-errors-in.html">thousands of errors</a> I found when parsing California's electronic statutes. This error (and others like it, &nbsp;including 28 U.S.C. 1932, 5 U.S.C. 5757) are in the U.S. Code itself. &nbsp;Another bump on the road to digitizing legislative information.<br /><br /><b>Update:</b> Upon further investigation, it seems that Congress has now repealed (at least one) section 139D. &nbsp;An update on the House website notes that "<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">Section repealed by Pub. L. 112-10, sec. 1858(b)(2)(A)". </span>This update raises its own questions, since the bill that became Pub. L. 112-110 (HR 1473), does not seem to have a section 1858.<br />
