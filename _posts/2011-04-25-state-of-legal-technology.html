I was recently prompted to answer a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-state-of-technology-currently-used-in-the-field-of-law">question on Quora</a> about the state of legal technology. My answer: fragmented and outdated.&nbsp;That answer included a few examples and raised two other questions: why is so much of legal technology anachronistic, and what can be done about it?<br /><br />I've set up this space, in part, to provide more detailed thoughts on these three questions.&nbsp;My friend and&nbsp;<a href="https://makinglawyershappy.com/">Tabulaw</a>&nbsp;advisor,&nbsp;<a href="https://sungmooncho.com/">Sungmoon Cho</a>, whose blog is very popular in Korea, has been an inspiration to do so in the form of a blog.<br /><br />I founded <a href="https://www.tabulaw.com/">Tabulaw</a>&nbsp;to tackle some of the problems with current legal technologies, which limit access to legal information and make the legal system inefficient.&nbsp;In developing and marketing Tabulaw's products, I've gained greater insight into some of the cultural and institutional barriers to improved legal technology. I've also been introduced to many of the&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/">technologies</a>&nbsp;that hackers have developed to make their own work&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">more efficient</a>, or at least&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/">more fun</a>, and am convinced the next generation of lawyers will be using many similar tools, as well.<br /><br />I am not the first to notice the lack of technical sophistication in law, or the major transformations&nbsp;that technology could bring to the profession. Richard Susskind's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.susskind.com/endoflawyers.html">End of Lawyers</a>, for example,&nbsp;identifies many of the structural problems with today's legal profession and the ways that technology may impact its future. &nbsp;Other insightful thinkers, including&nbsp;<a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a>&nbsp;at Harvard and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/">Ed Felten</a>&nbsp;at Princeton, have painted a picture of how technology could (or should?) transform the practice of law.<br /><br />I hope that this blog can add to these perspectives and provide another bridge between the technical and legal communities.
