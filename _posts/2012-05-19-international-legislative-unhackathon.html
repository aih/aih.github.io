State Senator Leland Yee made a personal appearance. (He's a sponsor of <a href="https://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1001-1050/sb_1002_bill_20120206_introduced.html" target="_blank">SB1002</a> in California, an open data bill.) Jim Harper and Francis Avila of the Cato Institute joined us. &nbsp;Professor David Jung, Director of UC Hastings' Center for State and Local Government Law worked on marking up a local ordinance.&nbsp;Tanzania, Italy and Japan were represented as were Washington, D.C. and Virginia. Rob Richards, as always, kept us all in communication. &nbsp;Terrific organization and inspiration by Charles Belle (UC Hastings), Pieter Gunst (Stanford) and Karen Suhaka (Denver).<br /><div><br /></div><div>We were also joined by a number of curious (bored?) men from Middle Eastern countries, apparently looking to chat with English speakers. Some stayed to listen.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Participants everywhere were able to learn about the emerging data standards for legislation (Akomo Ntosa), thanks to videos by Monica Palmieri and Grant Vergottini, and tried their hands at <a href="https://legalhacks.org/Editor/Map.html?map=usa_en" target="_blank">marking up legislation</a> from California and a number of other jurisdictions. &nbsp;We got some great feedback, which we're posting at&nbsp;code.google.com/p/legal-hack, and had some very productive discussions about Grant's HTML5 <a href="https://legalhacks.org/Editor/Editor.html" target="_blank">legislative editor</a>, the AKN standard, and the benefits of crowdsourcing vs. having a dedicated (paid) team to mark up legislation.</div><div><br /></div><div>The event was also an amazing lesson for me on the power of technology to engage the "long tail". &nbsp;After all, how many people are interested enough in legislative metadata to spend a beautiful Saturday in May hacking on it? There were 15-20 people each at Hastings and Stanford. &nbsp;The LegiNation group was in Denver, and through the Google+ hangout, Twitter feed and editor on legalhacks.org, many more people could participate virtually and, aside from the introductory presentations, asynchronously.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am particularly curious about how the experience was for virtual participants-- did you feel you could join in when and how you wanted? &nbsp;Was the Google+ experience satisfactory? &nbsp;What would you have liked to see more of?</div><div><br /></div><div>Legalhacks.org will be hosting a series of future events on structured legislation and we'd love to hear what you liked, what you didn't like and what you hope to see in future events.</div></div>
